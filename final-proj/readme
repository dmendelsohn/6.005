To run the real-time collaborative editor:
First run Server.java with args.
The first arg must be '-p'
The second arg is an integer representing the port number
Running Server.java without args results in the server listening in at localhost.

Running clients on different machines does not work because we could not determine how to open up a port at an MIT ip address.

Then, run ClientGUI.
In the first JDialog box, enter the host ip.
In the second JDialog box, enter the port number.
A main frame should open with buttons, a combo box, and a text field.
For the first client to connect to the server, click "New Document" and give it a title.
This will create a document with the specified title to work on. Otherwise, the text field is not editable.
Clicking "New Document" multiple times creates multiple documents.
Switch between documents by selecting the document title in the combo box.
Edit text of documents by typing and deleting with delete or backspace.
Do not hold down the 'delete' or 'backspace' key.
Format documents by clicking 'B' for toggling bold, 'I' for toggling italic, and 'U' for toggling underline.
Do not select text and click formatting buttons; these changes will not transmit between clients.
Clicking these buttons will also allow you to type in different formats.

Run ClientGUI each time you want a new client to connect to the server.
Enjoy real-time collaborative editing!
